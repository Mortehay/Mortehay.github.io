Create SPA that allows a user to Create, List, Update and Delete customers. A customer is made of up the following attributes:
• Name;
• Email;
• Telephone;
• Address;
◦ Street;
◦ City;
◦ State;
◦ Zip.

The web application should use MVW patterns, splitting logic into separate files 
(e.g.: app.js, create.js, list.js, etc.)

Also, the application must demonstrate your knowledge of HTML layout and responsive design.

Once you have completed the project, email me and we will set up some time to review.  Please also email me the final project.
